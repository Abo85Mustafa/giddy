v<1.1.1>, 2018-05-17

This release is the first tagged release of giddy on Github.
Starting from this release, giddy supports python 3.5 and 3.6 only.
This release also features categorical spatial Markov which enables spatial Markov
(class [Spatial_Markov](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/markov.py#L179))
to be applied to categorical time series such as land use and land cover change,
as well as neighborhood change. Here, the spatial lag (utilizing function
[lag_categorical](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/spatial_lag.py#L88)
in [libpysal](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal)) is defined as the most
common category among neighbors.
